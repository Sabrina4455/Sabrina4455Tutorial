# Vector vs bitmapped images

Unlike vector images, bitmapped images are made up of pixels. When a bitmapped image is resized, it loses quality. This will make the resolution of the image look fuzzy since itâ€™s not created from a mathematical equation like a vector image. Vector images are resolution independent and provide high resolution results.
