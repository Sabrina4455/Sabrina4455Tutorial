# Advantages Of Vector Images

There are many advantages of using vector images:

* Resolution: The resolution of a vector image will never lose quality since it can be scaled to any size, either larger or smaller, and still have the same resolution it started with.

* Editing: Vector images can be easily edited since you don’t have to redo the entire image if you want to change something. You can change the shape, color, lines, etc of a vector image unlike many other image types.

* File Size: The size of a vector image is much smaller than other types of images.
This is because a vector image stores its data as code which requires less memory compared to pixels.

* Scalability: Vector images can be scaled to any size and still have maximum
quality. After you scale a vector graphic the lines and curves will remain sharp and
not blocky.

# Disadvantages Of Vector Images 

There are many disadvantages of using vector images:

* Browser Support: Not as many web browsers or websites support vector images as they do for bitmapped images. 

* Realistic Imagery: Vector images don’t look as realistic and are not as detailed since they are created from a mathematical equation.

* Errors: Errors in a vector image drawing can be easily seen when enlarged since the quality of the image is so high.

* Time: Vector images can be very time consuming to create since they require a lot of precision and skill to make.
