# How to create a Bitmapped Image in Adobe Photoshop 

In this video, I created two different Bitmapped images out of a triangle using Adobe Photoshop. The two different sizes represent how Bitmapped images lose their quality when scaled compared to Vector Images that maintain their quality. I zoomed in to show how Bitmapped images are made from pixels instead of a mathmatical equation that Vector Images are made from which gives them their blurry low quality look along the edges.
