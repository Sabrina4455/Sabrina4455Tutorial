# How to create a Vector Image in Adobe Illustrator 

In this video, I created two different vector images out of a star. The two different sizes represent how vector images can be scaled and still maintain their quality. I zoomed in to show how vector images are made from a mathmatical equation instead of pixels which gives them their smooth high quality look along the edges.
